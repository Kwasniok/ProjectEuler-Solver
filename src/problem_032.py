The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through ''' + dye_input_var(9) + ''' pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
