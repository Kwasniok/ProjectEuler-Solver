        12 cm: (3,4,5)
        24 cm: (6,8,10)
        30 cm: (5,12,13)

        48 cm: (12,16,20)

In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.

120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ ''' + dye_input_var("1,500,000") + ''' can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?'''
